# Unit Test Workshop
## Introduction
This is a quick and dirty introduction into unit testing.  The aim is to show the evolution of code from **not** unit testable to unit testable.  I'll also introduce mocking with **Moq** and a nicer way to do your asserts with **Fluent Assertions**.

This is by no means an exhaustive or comprehensive workshop.  The aim is to give a gentle introduction and provide a platform for experimentation and learning.

This repo has a number of branches which will be worked through in turn.

## Step One
This branch introduces the library that we want to test.  The code isn't unit testable at this stage

## Step Two
In this branch we transform the code into a state which can be unit tested

## Step Three
There are three step three branches (step-three, step-three-b and step-three-c).  This step covers initial setup, writing a failing test and then writing the code needed to make the test pass

## Step Four
In the step four branches (step-four and step-four-b) Moq and Fluent Assertions are introduced.

## Step Five
There is no step five branch - clone the repo and use it as a playground!
